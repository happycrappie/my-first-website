# My first ever website

## This is how I started my career as a Web Developer

After three months studying code, I decided it was time for me to try out my skills on a real adventure.

My friend told me this marketing agency was hiring interns, so I opened up Sketch and Sublime and finished designing and coding this thing in exact two days and three nights. 

Surprisingly, they hired me - even though I had no idea those graphs about my knowledge were totally wrong, lol.
